Intra-host networks, including heterogeneous devices and interconnect fabrics, have become increasingly complex and crucial. However, intra-host networks today do not provide sufficient manageability. This prevents data center operators from running a reliable and efficient end-to-end network, especially for multi-tenant clouds. In this paper, we analyze the main manageability deficiencies of intra-host networks and argue that a systematic solution should be implemented to bridge this function gap. We propose two key building blocks for a manageable intra-host network: a fine-grained monitoring system and a holistic resource manager. We discuss the research questions associated with realizing these two building blocks.
